# Exchangagram
NYCDA collaborative project intended to emulate some of the features of IG
# What does our project does:
This is a simple Instagram clone app project we worked on for an assignment submission at NYCDA. You can Upload a picture, create yourself as a user, follow/delete that user(s) or delete your account.
# Setup:
To create this website we used Materialize on the Front End, and Node to run the server, SQL for our Database, and passport for our users login.
# How is it used:
clone this repo into your desktop, NPM install, and NPM start!
First - signup and submit a form to create your account, and simply upload a picture! :) you can see your posts in "my Profile" tab or see followers in the Followers tab. 
# status:
this project is still being worked on! we are currently rewriting our render functions and changing some front end to make it more user friendly.

# Collaborators:
Richard Hill (Backend - API Routes); Jose Marin (Backend - database and login); Randy Rodriguez (Frontend)
