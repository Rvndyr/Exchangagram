# Exchangagram
NYCDA collaborative project intended to emulate some of the features of IG
What does your project do?
This is a simple Instagram clone app project we worked on for an assignment submission at NYCDA. You can Upload a picture, create yourself as a user, follow/delete that user(s) or delete your account.
How is it set up? 
To create this website we used Materialize on the Front End, and Node to run the server, SQL for our Database, and passport for our users login.
How is it used? 
First - signup and submit a form to create your account, and simply upload a picture! :) you can see your posts in "my Profile" tab or see followers in the Followers tab. 
Is it in good shape?
this project is still being worked on! we are currently rewriting our render functions and changing some front end to make it more user friendly.

Collaborators: 
Richard Hill (Backend - API Routes); Jose Marin (Backend - database and login); Randy Rodriguez (Frontend)
